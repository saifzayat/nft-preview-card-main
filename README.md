## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I refined my knowledge of:

- **Hover states and pseudo-elements:** I learned how to create interactive hover states using `:hover` and `::after` pseudo-elements to display icons over images when hovered.
- **Responsive design:** By using CSS variables and media queries, I ensured that the layout adapts fluidly across different screen sizes.
- **React components:** I used React for creating modular, reusable components that make the structure of my code cleaner and more maintainable.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing more complex layout techniques, especially working with Flexbox and Grid. I also aim to improve my skills in optimizing images for the web.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Flexbox - This documentation helped me understand Flexbox better.
Google Fonts - I used the Outfit font from Google Fonts to style the text.
